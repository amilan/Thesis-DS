  abstract  = {The genome of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is, in addition to the translocation t(11;14), characterized by a high number of secondary chromosomal gains and losses that probably account for the various survival times of MCL patients. We investigated 77 primary MCL tumors with available clinical information using high-resolution RNA expression and genomic profiling and applied our recently developed gene expression and dosage integrator algorithm to identify novel genes and pathways that may be of relevance for the pathobiology of MCL. We show that copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity is common in MCL and targets regions that are frequently affected by deletions. The molecular consequences of genomic copy number changes appear complex, even in genomic loci with identified tumor suppressors, such as the region 9p21 containing the CDKN2A locus. Moreover, the deregulation of novel genes, such as CUL4A, ING1, and MCPH1, may affect the 2 crucial pathogenetic mechanisms in MCL, the disturbance of the proliferation, and DNA damage response pathways. Deregulation of the Hippo pathway may have a pathogenetic role in MCL because decreased expression of its members MOBKL2A, MOBKL2B, and LATS2 was associated with inferior outcome, including an independent validation series of 32 MCLs.},

  abstract = {A DNA microarray can track the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Previous research has demonstrated that this technology can be useful in the classification of cancers. Cancer microarray data normally contains a small number of samples which have a large number of gene expression levels as features. To select relevant genes involved in different types of cancer remains a challenge. In order to extract useful gene information from cancer microarray data and reduce dimensionality, feature selection algorithms were systematically investigated in this study. Using a correlation-based feature selector combined with machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, nave Bayes and support vector machines, we show that classification performance at least as good as published results can be obtained on acute leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma microarray data sets. We also demonstrate that a combined use of different classification and feature selection approaches makes it possible to select relevant genes with high confidence. This is also the first paper which discusses both computational and biological evidence for the involvement of zyxin in leukaemogenesis.},

  abstract  = {The identification of a subset of genes having the ability to capture the necessary information to distinguish classes of patients is crucial in bioinformatics applications. Ensemble and bagging methods have been shown to work effectively in the process of gene selection and classification. Testament to that is random forest which combines random decision trees with bagging to improve overall feature selection and classification accuracy. Surprisingly, the adoption of these methods in support vector machines has only recently received attention but mostly on classification not gene selection. This paper introduces an ensemble SVM-Recursive Feature Elimination (ESVM-RFE) for gene selection that follows the concepts of ensemble and bagging used in random forest but adopts the backward elimination strategy which is the rationale of RFE algorithm. The rationale behind this is, building ensemble SVM models using randomly drawn bootstrap samples from the training set, will produce different feature rankings which will be subsequently aggregated as one feature ranking. As a result, the decision for elimination of features is based upon the ranking of multiple SVM models instead of choosing one particular model. Moreover, this approach will address the problem of imbalanced datasets by constructing a nearly balanced bootstrap sample. Our experiments show that ESVM-RFE for gene selection substantially increased the classification performance on five microarray datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on the childhood leukaemia dataset show that an average 9% better accuracy is achieved by ESVM-RFE over SVM-RFE, and 5% over random forest based approach. The selected genes by the ESVM-RFE algorithm were further explored with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) which reveals significant clusters with the selected data.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective
Detection of metastatic tumor cells is important for early diagnosis and staging of cancer. However, such cells are exceedingly difficult to detect from blood or biopsy samples at the disease onset. It is reported that cancer cells, and especially metastatic tumor cells, show very distinctive morphological behavior compared to their healthy counterparts on aptamer functionalized substrates. The ability to quickly analyze the data and quantify the cell morphology for an instant real-time feedback can certainly contribute to early cancer diagnosis. A supervised machine learning approach is presented for identification and classification of cancer cell gestures for early diagnosis.
Methods
We quantified the morphologically distinct behavior of metastatic cells and their healthy counterparts captured on aptamer-functionalized glass substrates from time-lapse optical micrographs. As a proof of concept, the morphologies of human glioblastoma (hGBM) and astrocyte cells were used. The cells were captured and imaged with an optical microscope. Multiple feature vectors were extracted to quantify and differentiate the complex physical gestures of cancerous and non-cancerous cells. Three different classifier models, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Tree (RFT), and Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC) were trained with the known dataset using machine learning algorithms. The performances of the classifiers were compared for accuracy, precision, and recall measurements using five-fold cross-validation technique.
Results
All the classifier models detected the cancer cells with an average accuracy of at least 82%. The NBC performed the best among the three classifiers in terms of Precision (0.91), Recall (0.9), and F1-score (0.89) for the existing dataset.
Conclusions
This paper presents a standalone system built on machine learning techniques for cancer screening based on cell gestures. The system offers rapid, efficient, and novel identification of hGBM brain tumor cells and can be extended to define single cell analysis metrics for many other types of tumor cells.},

  abstract = {The DNA microarray technology has capability to determine the levels of thousands of gene simultaneously in a single experiment. Analysis of gene expression is important in many fields of biological research in order to retrieve the required information. As time progresses, the illness in general and cancer in particular have become more and more complex and complicated, in detecting, analyzing and curing. We know cancer is deadly disease. Cancer research is one of the major area of research in medical field. Predicting precisely of different tumor types is a great challenge and providing accurate prediction will have great value in providing better treatment to the patients. To achieve this, data mining algorithms are important tools and the most extensively used approach to achieve important feature of gene expression data and plays an important role for gene classification. One of major challenges is to discover how to extract useful information from huge datasets. This paper presents recent advances in the machine learning based gene expression data analysis with different feature selection algorithms. Gene expression profiles, which represent the state of a cell at a molecular level, have great potential as a medical diagnosis tool. But compared to the number of genes involved, available training data sets generally have a fairly small sample size for classification. These training data limitations constitute a challenge to certain classification methodologies. Feature selection techniques can be used to extract the marker genes which influence the classification accuracy effectively by eliminating the un wanted noisy and redundant genes This paper presents a review of feature selection techniques that have been employed in micro array data based cancer classification and also the predominant role of SVM for cancer classification.},

  abstract  = {Cyclin D1 is an oncogene frequently overexpressed in human cancers that has a dual function as cell cycle and transcriptional regulator, although the latter is widely unexplored. Here, we investigated the transcriptional role of cyclin D1 in lymphoid tumor cells with cyclin D1 oncogenic overexpression. Cyclin D1 showed widespread binding to the promoters of most actively transcribed genes, and the promoter occupancy positively correlated with the transcriptional output of targeted genes. Despite this association, the overexpression of cyclin D1 in lymphoid cells led to a global transcriptional downmodulation that was proportional to cyclin D1 levels. This cyclin D1–dependent global transcriptional downregulation was associated with a reduced nascent transcription and an accumulation of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) that colocalized with cyclin D1. Concordantly, cyclin D1 overexpression promoted an increase in the Poll II pausing index. This transcriptional impairment seems to be mediated by the interaction of cyclin D1 with the transcription machinery. In addition, cyclin D1 overexpression sensitized cells to transcription inhibitors, revealing a synthetic lethality interaction that was also observed in primary mantle cell lymphoma cases. This finding of global transcriptional dysregulation expands the known functions of oncogenic cyclin D1 and suggests the therapeutic potential of targeting the transcriptional machinery in cyclin D1–overexpressing tumors.},
  comment   = {Cyclin D1 - Oncogen overexpressed in human cancers. Has dual function as cell cycle and transcriptional regulator (widely unexplored).

whether oncogenic overexpression of cyclin D1 is responsible for transcriptional dysregulation in cancer cells remains unknown.


cyclin D1, such as amplification of the translocated allele or secondary rearrangements and mutations involving the 3′ untranslated region that generate more stable CCND1 transcripts (19–21). The expression of these abnormal transcripts correlates with the presence of higher protein levels and increased aggressiveness of the tumors 


cyclin D1 binds to the promoters of most actively transcribed genes, and its overexpression led to global downmodulation of the transcriptome program. This effect was associated with an accumulation of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) that overlapped with cyclin D1–bound regions.


Functional pathway analysis of genes showing cyclin D1 occupancy at promoters revealed that these genes were related to processes such as translation, RNA processing, cell cycle, and DNA damage and repair, among others

Taken together, these results indicate that cyclin D1 binds to regions of open chromatin enriched in active histone marks, which include promoters and enhancers.

Cyclin D1 occupies promoters of highly expressed genes.

Genome-wide recruitment of exogenous cyclin D1 to active gene promoters.

Cyclin D1 overexpression leads to a global reduction in RNA synthesis in lymphoid cells. 

these results suggest that cyclin D1 oncogenic overexpression induces a reduction in steady-state RNA levels in a dose-dependent manner by decreasing total transcription.

Cyclin D1 produces a global downmodulation of mRNAs in lymphoid cells

Cyclin D1 physically interacts with the transcription machinery and increases promoter-proximal Pol II pausing

Cyclin D1 overexpression sensitizes cells to transcription inhibitors

the overexpression of cyclin D1 in lymphoid cells was responsible for a significant reduction in cell RNA content that was proportional to cyclin D1 protein levels, an effect that was cell cycle independent and was related to a reduced transcription rate.

Thus, cyclin D1 seems to act as global transcriptome regulator, decreasing the overall gene transcription program of the cells. As far as we know, this is the first time that a global transcription downregulation effect has been reported for a protein outside the basal transcription machinery.

... suggests the existence of a synthetic lethality between cyclin D1 overexpression and transcription inhibition. This lethal interaction opens opportunities for new treatment strategies in cyclin D1–overexpressing tumors

The identification of a cyclin D1–dependent global transcriptional downmodulation may seem at first glance inconsistent with a potential oncogenic effect of cyclin D1 in MCL, and raises the question about its potential significance.

 Further studies should clarify whether this downmodulation responds to a physiological role of cyclin D1.

Further studies should clarify the potential conflicts between promoter-proximal paused Pol II mediated by cyclin D1 overexpression and DNA replication forks.

  abstract        = {Cyclin D1 is a component of the core cell cycle machinery. Abnormally high levels of cyclin D1 are detected in many human cancer types. To elucidate the molecular functions of cyclin D1 in human cancers, we performed a proteomic screen for cyclin D1 protein partners in several types of human tumours. Analyses of cyclin D1 interactors revealed a network of DNA repair proteins, including RAD51, a recombinase that drives the homologous recombination process. We found that cyclin D1 directly binds RAD51, and that cyclin D1-RAD51 interaction is induced by radiation. Like RAD51, cyclin D1 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a BRCA2-dependent fashion. Reduction of cyclin D1 levels in human cancer cells impaired recruitment of RAD51 to damaged DNA, impeded the homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair, and increased sensitivity of cells to radiation in vitro and in vivo. This effect was seen in cancer cells lacking the retinoblastoma protein, which do not require D-cyclins for proliferation. These findings reveal an unexpected function of a core cell cycle protein in DNA repair and suggest that targeting cyclin D1 may be beneficial also in retinoblastoma-negative cancers which are currently thought to be unaffected by cyclin D1 inhibition.},

  abstract        = {Cyclin D1 is an important molecular driver of human breast cancer but better understanding of its oncogenic mechanisms is needed, especially to enhance efforts in targeted therapeutics. Currently, pharmaceutical initiatives to inhibit cyclin D1 are focused on the catalytic component since the transforming capacity is thought to reside in the cyclin D1/CDK activity. We initiated the following study to directly test the oncogenic potential of catalytically inactive cyclin D1 in an in vivo mouse model that is relevant to breast cancer. Herein, transduction of cyclin D1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with the kinase dead KE mutant of cyclin D1 led to aneuploidy, abnormalities in mitotic spindle formation, autosome amplification, and chromosomal instability (CIN) by gene expression profiling. Acute transgenic expression of either cyclin D1(WT) or cyclin D1(KE) in the mammary gland was sufficient to induce a high CIN score within 7 days. Sustained expression of cyclin D1(KE) induced mammary adenocarcinoma with similar kinetics to that of the wild-type cyclin D1. ChIP-Seq studies demonstrated recruitment of cyclin D1(WT) and cyclin D1(KE) to the genes governing CIN. We conclude that the CDK-activating function of cyclin D1 is not necessary to induce either chromosomal instability or mammary tumorigenesis.},

  abstract        = {Cyclin D1 belongs to the core cell cycle machinery, and it is frequently overexpressed in human cancers. The full repertoire of cyclin D1 functions in normal development and oncogenesis is unclear at present. Here we developed Flag- and haemagglutinin-tagged cyclin D1 knock-in mouse strains that allowed a high-throughput mass spectrometry approach to search for cyclin D1-binding proteins in different mouse organs. In addition to cell cycle partners, we observed several proteins involved in transcription. Genome-wide location analyses (chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to DNA microarray; ChIP-chip) showed that during mouse development cyclin D1 occupies promoters of abundantly expressed genes. In particular, we found that in developing mouse retinas-an organ that critically requires cyclin D1 function-cyclin D1 binds the upstream regulatory region of the Notch1 gene, where it serves to recruit CREB binding protein (CBP) histone acetyltransferase. Genetic ablation of cyclin D1 resulted in decreased CBP recruitment, decreased histone acetylation of the Notch1 promoter region, and led to decreased levels of the Notch1 transcript and protein in cyclin D1-null (Ccnd1(-/-)) retinas. Transduction of an activated allele of Notch1 into Ccnd1(-/-) retinas increased proliferation of retinal progenitor cells, indicating that upregulation of Notch1 signalling alleviates the phenotype of cyclin D1-deficiency. These studies show that in addition to its well-established cell cycle roles, cyclin D1 has an in vivo transcriptional function in mouse development. Our approach, which we term 'genetic-proteomic', can be used to study the in vivo function of essentially any protein.},

The publication of studies with dissimilar or altogether contradictory results, obtained using different microarray platforms to analyze identical RNA samples, has raised concerns about the reliability of this technology. The MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project was initiated to address these concerns, as well as other performance and data analysis issues. Expression data on four titration pools from two distinct reference RNA samples were generated at multiple test sites using a variety of microarray-based and alternative technology platforms. Here we describe the experimental design and probe mapping efforts behind the MAQC project. We show intraplatform consistency across test sites as well as a high level of interplatform concordance in terms of genes identified as differentially expressed. This study provides a resource that represents an important first step toward establishing a framework for the use of microarrays in clinical and regulatory settings.},

  abstract        = {Due to experimental batch effects, the application of a quantitative transcriptional signature for disease diagnoses commonly requires inter-sample data normalization, which would be hardly applicable under common clinical settings. Many cancers might have qualitative differences with the non-cancer states in the gene expression pattern. Therefore, it is reasonable to explore the power of qualitative diagnostic signatures which are robust against experimental batch effects and other random factors. Firstly, using data of technical replicate samples from the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project, we demonstrated that the low-throughput PCR-based technologies also exist large measurement variations for gene expression even when the samples were measured in the same test site. Then, we demonstrated the critical limitation of low stability for classifiers based on quantitative transcriptional signatures in applications to individual samples through a case study using a support vector machine and a naïve Bayesian classifier to discriminate colorectal cancer tissues from normal tissues. To address this problem, we identified a signature consisting of three gene pairs for discriminating colorectal cancer tissues from non-cancer (normal and inflammatory bowel disease) tissues based on within-sample relative expression orderings (REOs) of these gene pairs. The signature was well verified using 22 independent datasets measured by different microarray and RNA_seq platforms, obviating the need of inter-sample data normalization. Subtle quantitative information of gene expression measurements tends to be unstable under current technical conditions, which will introduce uncertainty to clinical applications of the quantitative transcriptional diagnostic signatures. For diagnosis of disease states with qualitative transcriptional characteristics, the qualitative REO-based signatures could be robustly applied to individual samples measured by different platforms.},

Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation.

An MCL gene expression signature defined a large subset of MCLs that expressed cyclin D1 and a novel subset that lacked cyclin D1 expression. A precise measurement of tumor cell proliferation, provided by the expression of proliferation signature genes, identified patient subsets that differed by more than 5 years in median survival. Differences in cyclin D1 mRNA abundance synergized with INK4a/ARF locus deletions to dictate tumor proliferation rate and survival. We propose a quantitative model of the aberrant cell cycle regulation in MCL that provides a rationale for the design of cell cycle inhibitor therapy in this malignancy.},

A biologically and clinically heterogeneous lymphoma, MCL, remains clinically challenging, with no proven curative therapy and no established standard of care. However, there have been considerable advances in the last several years in the treatment and understanding of MCL with the FDA approval of lenalidomide and ibrutinib, the development of other potentially active novel agents and the identification of recurrent mutations through new genomic sequencing approaches that may contribute to the biology of MCL and to therapeutic resistance. At the Lymphoma Research Foundation's 11th MCL Workshop, researchers gathered to discuss recent studies and current issues related to the biology of MCL, novel therapeutic targets and new treatment strategies. The presentations are summarized in this manuscript, which is intended to highlight areas of active investigation and identify topics for future research. },

Although some patients may follow an indolent clinical evolution, in most of them the tumour has an aggressive behaviour with poor response to conventional chemotherapy. The genetic hallmark is the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation leading to the overexpression of cyclin D1, which is considered the initial oncogenic event. In addition to this translocation, MCL may carry a high number of secondary chromosomal and molecular alterations that target regulatory elements of the cell cycle machinery and senescence (BMI1/INK4/ARF/CDK4/RB1), DNA damage response pathways (ATM/CHK2/p53), and cell survival signals. The knowledge of these mechanisms and their influence on the behaviour of the tumour are facilitating the development of prognostic models with a more precise prediction of the clinical evolution of the patients. This information coupled with the availability of a new generation of innovative drugs targeting basic molecular process of the tumour cells, should facilitate the design of new therapeutic protocols able to overcome the resistance of this aggressive lymphoma to conventional treatments and improve the life expectancy of the patients.},

Activation of the cyclin D1 oncogene, often by amplification or rearrangement, is a major driver of multiple types of human tumors including breast and squamous cell cancers, B-cell lymphoma, myeloma and parathyroid adenoma. In this review, the authors summarize the activity of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases in cell-cycle progression and transcription. They focus on cyclin D1/CDK4/CDK6, a central mediator in the transition from G1 to S phase. Furthermore, the authors discuss the first generation of pan-cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that failed to meet expectation and discuss, in detail, the second generation of highly specific cyclin D1/CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors that are proving to be more efficacious. The mechanism by which cyclin D1 drives tumorigenesis may be dependent on kinase and kinase-independent functions. Further evidence is necessary to delineate the roles of cyclin D1 in early pre-neoplastic lesions where its overexpression may promote genomic instability in a kinase-independent manner.},

  abstract        = {Cell cycle activation is coordinated by D-type cyclins which are rate limiting and essential for the progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. D-type cyclins bind to and activate the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk4 and Cdk6, which in turn phosphorylate their downstream target, the retinoblastoma protein Rb. Upon Rb phosphorylation, the E2F transcription factors activate the expression of S-phase genes and thereby induce cell cycle progression. The raise of cyclin D levels in early G1 also serves to titrate Kip/Cip proteins away from cyclinE/Cdk2 complexes, further accelerating cell cycle progression. Therefore, cyclin D plays essential roles in the response to mitogens, transmitting their signal to the Rb/E2F pathway. Surprisingly, cyclin D1-deficient animals are viable and have developmental abnormalities limited to restricted tissues, such as retina, the nervous system and breast epithelium. This observation, combined with several other studies, have raised the possibility that cyclin D1 may have new activities that are unrelated to its function as a cdk regulatory subunit and as regulator of Rb. Effectively, cyclin D has been reported to have transcriptional functions since it interacts with several transcription factors to regulate their activity. Most often, this effect does not rely on the kinase function of Cdk4, indicating that this function is probably independent of cell cycle progression. Further extending its role in gene regulation, cyclin D interacts with histone acetylases such as P/CAF or NcoA/SRC1a but also with components of the transcriptional machinery such as TAF(II)250. Therefore, these studies suggest that the functions of cyclin D might need to be reevaluated. They have established a new cdk-independent role of cyclin D1 as a transcriptional regulator, indicating that cyclin D1 can act via two different mechanisms, as a cdk activator it regulates cell cycle progression and as a transcriptional regulator, it modulates the activity of transcription factors.},

  abstract        = {The t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation and its molecular counterpart bcl-1 rearrangement are frequently associated with mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs) and only occasionally with other variants of B-cell lymphoid malignancies. This translocation seems to activate the expression of PRAD-1/cyclin D1 gene located downstream from the major breakpoint cluster region of this rearrangement. However, the possible overexpression of this gene in other lymphoproliferative disorders independently of bcl-1 rearrangement is unknown. We have examined the overexpression of PRAD-1 gene in a large series of 142 lymphoproliferative disorders including 20 MCLs by Northern blot analysis. Cytogenetic and/or bcl-1 rearrangement analysis with 2 probes (MTC, p94PS) were performed in 28 cases. Strong PRAD-1 overexpression was observed in 19 of the 20 MCLs including 3 gastrointestinal forms and 4 blastic variants. t(11;14) and/or bcl-1 rearrangement was detected in 6 of the 12 MCLs examined. No correlation was found between the different levels of mRNA expression and the pathologic characteristics of the lymphoma. Among chronic lymphoproliferative disorders other than MCL, only 1 atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with a t(11;14) translocation and bcl-1 rearrangement and the 2 hairy cell leukemias (HCLs) analyzed showed upregulation of PRAD-1 gene. The expression in the 2 HCLs was lower than in MCL, and no bcl-1 rearrangement was observed. These findings indicate that PRAD-1 overexpression is a highly sensitive and specific molecular marker of MCL but it may also be upregulated in some B-CLLs and in HCL.},

  abstract        = {PRAD-1 is a putative oncogene localized on chromosome 11q13 which encodes cyclin D1, a novel cyclin involved in cell cycle regulation. Amplification of this gene has recently been reported in several human tumors including breast and head and neck carcinomas. In this study we have analyzed the presence of PRAD-1/cyclin D1 gene amplification and mRNA overexpression in a series of 46 matched normal mucosas and squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. PRAD-1/cyclin D1 was found to be amplified 2- to 12-fold in 17 carcinomas (37%). DNA amplification correlated with advanced local invasion (P = 0.0015), presence of lymph node metastases (P = 0.0078), and stage IV of the tumors (P = 0.0021). mRNA overexpression was found in 15 of the 43 (35%) cases examined and it was also significantly associated with advanced local invasion (P = 0.0025) and stage IV carcinomas (P = 0.0032). A significant association was observed between gene amplification and mRNA overexpression (P < 0.0001) with only 3 discordant cases (2 amplifications with no overexpression and 1 overexpressed carcinoma with no gene amplification). Furthermore, the degree of DNA amplification correlated with the levels of mRNA expression (r = 0.6; P = 0.024). These findings suggest that the PRAD-1/cyclin D1 gene may be an important target of 11q13 amplifications in laryngeal carcinomas and the activation of this gene may be involved in the progression of these tumors. Its association with advanced-stage tumors indicates that PRAD-1/cyclin D1 gene amplification and overexpression may be of prognostic significance.},

Cyclin D1/PRAD1 is a likely "driver" gene for this amplicon because of its role in cell cycle control and because it has been specifically implicated as an oncogene in parathyroid adenomas and B-cell lymphomas with 11q13 translocation breakpoints. We examined cyclin D1 protein expression in 48 consecutive cases of infiltrating mammary carcinoma using an affinity-purified polyclonal antisera to cyclin D1 and a microwave/citrate buffer antigen retrieval system. Staining data were correlated with clinicopathological features, protein detection by immunoblots, and 11q13 DNA amplification. Definite nuclear staining was seen in 17/48 (35%) tumors (16 infiltrating ductal carcinomas, predominantly grade 2/3, and one infiltrating lobular carcinoma). There was no nuclear staining of normal breast epithelium, fat cells, or admixed lymphocytes. Tumors with overexpression of cyclin D1 were estrogen receptor-positive (P < .005) and usually progesterone receptor-positive (P < .005) but otherwise were similar to other negative cases in the study group. Correlation between Western blot and immunostaining data was excellent (P < .01). Five of the 22 cases studied showed 11q13 DNA amplification as well as increased levels of cyclin D1 protein by Western blot and immunostaining. Four cases with increased cyclin D1 protein by both western blots and immunohistochemistry did not have detectable 11q13 amplification. Nuclear cyclin D1 protein can be detected in approximately one-third of infiltrating breast carcinomas using an immunohistochemical technique on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract        = {Therapy resistance and poor outcome in prostate cancer is associated with increased expression of cyclin D1. Androgens promote DNA double-strand break repair to reduce DNA damage, and cyclin D1 was also shown to enhance DNA damage repair (DDR). In this study, we investigated the significance of cyclin D1 in androgen-induced DDR using established prostate cancer cells and prostate tissues from cyclin D1 knockout mice. We demonstrate that endogenous cyclin D1 further diminished the dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-dependent reduction of γH2AX foci in vitro. We also show that cyclin D1 was required for the androgen-dependent DNA damage response both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, cyclin D1 was required for androgen-enhanced DDR and radioresistance of prostate cancer cells. Moreover, microarray analysis of primary prostate epithelial cells from cyclin D1-deficient and wild-type mice demonstrated that most of the DHT-dependent gene expression changes are also cyclin D1 dependent. Collectively, our findings suggest that the hormone-mediated recruitment of cyclin D1 to sites of DDR may facilitate the resistance of prostate cancer cells to DNA damage therapies and highlight the need to explore other therapeutic approaches in prostate cancer to prevent or overcome drug resistance.},

  abstract        = {Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are active in cancer cells that have impaired repair of DNA by the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. Strategies that disrupt HR may sensitize HR-proficient tumors to PARP inhibition. As a component of the core cell cycle machinery, cyclin D1 has unexpected function in DNA repair, suggesting that targeting cyclin D1 may represent a plausible strategy for expanding the utility of PARPi in ovarian cancer. BRCA1 wildtype ovarian cancer cells (A2780 and SKOV3) were treated with a combination of CCND1 siRNA and olaparib in vitro. Cell viability was assessed by MTT. The effects of the combined treatment on DNA damage repair and cell cycle progression were examined to dissect molecular mechanisms. In vivo studies were performed in an orthotopic ovarian cancer mouse model. Animals were treated with a combination of lentivirus-mediated CCND1 shRNA and olaparib or olaparib plus scrambled shRNA. Molecular downstream effects were examined by immunohistochemistry. Silencing of cyclin D1 sensitized ovarian cancer cells to olaparib through interfering with RAD51 accumulation and inducing cell cycle G0/G1 arrest. Treatment of lentivirus-mediated CCND1-shRNA in nude mice statistically significantly augmented the olaparib response (mean tumor weight ± SD, CCND1-shRNA plus olaparib vs scrambled shRNA plus olaparib: 0.172 ± 0.070 g vs 0.324 ± 0.044 g, P< 0.05). Silencing of cyclin D1 combined with olaparib may lead to substantial benefit for ovarian cancer management by mimicking a BRCAness phenotype, and induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest.},

Both aberrant cyclin D1 expression and underlying chromosomal aberration may be used as molecular targets for monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD). The present study aims to assess the usefulness of quantitative cyclin D1 gene expression compared to the standardised but more technologically demanding DNA-based method for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) or t(11;14) clone-specific gene rearrangement quantification in a cohort of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from patients with MCL. We simultaneously evaluated DNA-MRD and cyclin D1 expression levels in 234 samples from 57 patients. We observed that both in DNA-MRD positive and negative BM/PB pairs from the same time points the expression levels of cyclin D1 are lower in PB than in BM (median 19×, BM/PB range 0.41-352). The correlation of cyclin D1 transcript levels with DNA-MRD or with flow cytometry was good only in samples with a very high infiltration. In DNA-MRD-negative BM samples, we observed a significant heterogeneity of cyclin D1 expression (in the range of more than three orders of magnitude). This is in contrast to previous reports demonstrating the usefulness of cyclin D1 for MRD monitoring that did not use DNA-based method as a reference. In PB, the specificity of cyclin D1 expression was better due to a lower physiological background. In conclusion, we show that cyclin D1 is unsuitable for MRD monitoring in BM.},

In this study, we proposed an integrative machine learning approach to analyse multiple gene expression profiles in cervical cancer in order to identify a set of genetic markers that are associated with and may eventually aid in the diagnosis or prognosis of cervical cancers. The proposed integrative analysis is composed of three steps: namely, (i) gene expression analysis of individual dataset; (ii) meta-analysis of multiple datasets; and (iii) feature selection and machine learning analysis. As a result, 21 gene expressions were identified through the integrative machine learning analysis which including seven supervised and one unsupervised methods. A functional analysis with GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) was performed on the selected 21-gene expression set and showed significant enrichment in a nine-potential gene expression signature, namely   and   (upregulated genes) and   and   (downregulated genes).},

  abstract  = {BackgroundThere exist many methods for describing the complex relation between changes of gene expression in molecular pathways or gene ontologies under different experimental conditions. Among them, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis seems to be one of the most commonly used (over 10,000 citations). An important parameter, which could affect the final result, is the choice of a metric for the ranking of genes. Applying a default ranking metric may lead to poor results.Methods and resultsIn this work 28 benchmark data sets were used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positive rate of gene set analysis for 16 different ranking metrics including new proposals. Furthermore, the robustness of the chosen methods to sample size was tested. Using k-means clustering algorithm a group of four metrics with the highest performance in terms of overall sensitivity, overall false positive rate and computational load was established i.e. absolute value of Moderated Welch Test statistic, Minimum Significant Difference, absolute value of Signal-To-Noise ratio and Baumgartner-Weiss-Schindler test statistic. In case of false positive rate estimation, all selected ranking metrics were robust with respect to sample size. In case of sensitivity, the absolute value of Moderated Welch Test statistic and absolute value of Signal-To-Noise ratio gave stable results, while Baumgartner-Weiss-Schindler and Minimum Significant Difference showed better results for larger sample size. Finally, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis method with all tested ranking metrics was parallelised and implemented in MATLAB, and is available at https://github.com/ZAEDPolSl/MrGSEA.ConclusionsChoosing a ranking metric in Gene Set Enrichment Analysis has critical impact on results of pathway enrichment analysis. The absolute value of Moderated Welch Test has the best overall sensitivity and Minimum Significant Difference has the best overall specificity of gene set analysis. When the number of non-normally distributed genes is high, using Baumgartner-Weiss-Schindler test statistic gives better outcomes. Also, it finds more enriched pathways than other tested metrics, which may induce new biological discoveries.},

  abstract  = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

Distinct sequential temporal phases, Gap 1 (G ), Gap 0 (G ), Synthesis (S), Gap 2 (G ) and Mitosis (M) are negotiated through a series of check points during which the favorability of the local cellular environment is assessed, prior to replicating DNA [1]. Cyclin D1 has been characterized as a key regulatory subunit of the holoenzyme that promotes the G /S-phase transition through phosphorylating the pRB protein. Cyclin D1 overexpression is considered a driving force in several types of cancers and cdk inhibitors are being used effectively in the clinic for treatment of ERα  breast cancer [1, 2]. Genomic DNA is assaulted by damaging ionizing radiation, chemical carcinogens, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are generated by cellular metabolism. Furthermore, specific hormones including estrogens [3, 4] and androgens [5] govern pathways that damage DNA. Defects in the DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathway can lead to genomic instability and cancer. Evidence is emerging that cyclin D1 bind proteins involved in DNA repair including BRCA1 [6], RAD51 [7], BRCA2 [8] and is involved in the DNA damage and DNA repair processes [7, 8]. Because the repair of damaged DNA appears to be an important and unexpected role for cyclin D1, and inhibitors of cyclin D1-dependent kinase activity are being used in the clinic, the latest findings on the role of cyclin D1 in mediating the DDR including the DDR induced by the hormones estrogen [9] and androgen [10, 11] is reviewed.},

Functional analyses confirmed the involvement of C/EBPbeta in the regulation of genes affected by cyclin D1 and established this protein as an indispensable effector of a potentially important facet of cyclin D1 biology.

To construct a gene network, correlations or associations among pairs of genes must be obtained. However, when gene expression data are heterogeneous with high levels of noise for samples assigned to the same condition, it is difficult to accurately determine whether a gene pair represents a significant gene-gene interaction (GGI). In order to solve this problem, we proposed a random forest-based method to classify significant GGIs from gene expression data. To train the model, we defined novel feature sets and utilised various high-confidence interactome datasets to deduce the correct answer set from known disease-specific genes. Using Alzheimer's disease data, the proposed method showed remarkable accuracy, and the GGIs established in the analysis can be used to build a meaningful genetic network that can explain the mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease.},

Recently, several large-scale studies have shed light on this problem through analysis of gene expression profiles to identify markers correlated with metastasis. Here, we apply a protein-network-based approach that identifies markers not as individual genes but as subnetworks extracted from protein interaction databases. The resulting subnetworks provide novel hypotheses for pathways involved in tumor progression. Although genes with known breast cancer mutations are typically not detected through analysis of differential expression, they play a central role in the protein network by interconnecting many differentially expressed genes. We find that the subnetwork markers are more reproducible than individual marker genes selected without network information, and that they achieve higher accuracy in the classification of metastatic versus non-metastatic tumors.},

No longer characterized by a uniformly dismal prognosis, mantle cell lymphoma has been revealed as a spectrum of different diseases, ranging from very indolent cases to highly aggressive and refractory ones. Thus, there is an urgent need to adapt therapy to accommodate the diverse presentations of the disease. High-dose chemotherapy, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is the current standard of care for younger patients, generally providing high responses and long survival rates, but hampered by acute and long-term toxicity. In addition, some patients may be overtreated, while others could benefit from targeted approaches, based on the new, molecular-directed compounds. Such a personalized treatment based on the specific characteristics of individual patients may be guided by validated prognostic tools, such as the Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index and the Ki-67 Proliferative Index, as well as by early predictors of treatment response, like minimal residual disease analysis. Moreover, mutation screening of distinctive genomic alterations may provide new, predictive biomarkers, with an additional impact on clinical practice. Only after tailoring treatment according to the clinical and biological heterogeneity of the disease the role of transplantation and modern therapeutic options will be redefined in mantle cell lymphoma. },

In this review, we first provide a general overview of MCL and then discuss about the role of biomarkers in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment for MCL. We attempt to discuss major biomarkers for MCL and highlight published and ongoing clinical trials in an effort to evaluate the dominant signaling pathways as drugable targets for treating MCL so as to determine the potential combination of drugs for both untreated and relapse/refractory cases. Our analysis indicates that incorporation of biomarkers is crucial for patient stratification and improve diagnosis and predictability of disease outcome thus help us in designing future precision therapies.

Here, we showed that RNA interference-mediated depletion of CCND1 increased caspase-3 activities and induced apoptosis in the human MCL lines UPN-1 and JEKO-1. In vitro and xenotransplant studies revealed that the toxic effect of CCND1 depletion in MCL cells was likely due to increase in histone H2AX phosphorylation, a DNA damage marker. DNA fiber analysis suggested deregulated replication initiation after CCND1 depletion as a potential cause of DNA damage. Finally, in contrast to depletion or inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4, CCND1 depletion increased chemosensitivity of MCL cells to replication inhibitors hydroxyurea and cytarabine. Our findings have an important implication for CCND1 as a potential therapeutic target in MCL patients who are refractory to standard chemotherapy.},

  abstract        = {Cyclin D1 overexpression is the hallmark of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). However, the importance of cyclin D1 in the maintenance and progression of the disease remains to be defined. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of cyclin D1 overexpression using an efficient cyclin D1-shRNA and a lentiviral system in well-characterized MCL cell lines. Surprisingly, the knockdown of cyclin D1 led to a moderate retardation in growth, without induction of apoptosis. The cyclin D1-shRNA-transduced MCL cells showed a 15% shift from S phase to G(1) phase of the cell cycle, a weak induction of p27(Kip1), decreased Rb (Ser807/811) phosphorylation, and a consistent upregulation of cyclin D2 mRNA and protein expression. However, double knockdown of cyclins D1 and D2 did not intensify the effects observed with cyclin D1 knockdown alone. These data suggest that the moderate effects of cyclin D1 downregulation on survival and proliferation are likely the result of compensatory cyclin-independent mechanisms governing proliferation or alternatively, secondary genetic events that make cyclin D1 dispensable. These findings have important implications for MCL therapy, as strategies targeting only cyclin D1 function might be hampered by compensatory regulatory mechanisms, resulting in a low probability of treatment response.},

Although molecular techniques have unified the diagnostic approach to MCL, no therapeutic advances have been made to target this particular pathway. The significance of CCND1 in the pathogenesis and treatment of MCL has yet to be defined. We have taken advantage of RNA interference (RNAi) to down-regulate CCND1 expression in two MCL cell lines (Granta-519 and Jeko-1) to investigate the cytotoxic effect of combining RNAi with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. We designed four small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific to CCND1, one specific to CCND2, and one dual-targeting siRNA that simultaneously down-regulates CCND1 and CCND2. Etoposide and doxorubicin were used as chemotherapeutics in combination with the siRNAs. The transfected siRNAs in MCL cell lines triggered 40-60% reduction in target mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, the siRNA-mediated reduction in cyclins resulted in decreased IC(50) (50% inhibitory concentration) values for both doxorubicin and etoposide. The combination of siRNA-mediated inhibition of the cyclins along with chemotherapeutic agents could potentially be used to lower the effective doses of the chemotherapeutic agents and reduce drug-related toxicities.},

Melanoma cells harboring shRNAs targeting several DNA damage response (DDR) kinases had a greater selective disadvantage in vivo than in vitro, indicating an essential contribution of these factors during tumor expansion. In growing tumors, DDR kinases were activated following hypoxia. Correspondingly, depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of DDR kinases was toxic to melanoma cells, including those that were resistant to BRAF inhibitor, and this could be enhanced by angiogenesis blockade. These results reveal that hypoxia sensitizes melanomas to targeted inhibition of the DDR and illustrate the utility of in vivo shRNA dropout screens for the identification of pharmacologically tractable targets.},

It is accompanied by widespread changes in gene expression mediated largely through the transcription factors HIF1/2/3α. Hypoxia impacts on multiple pathways throughout the cell and has widespread effects on phenotype. Here we use sample-specific annotation approaches to determine the changes in transcript architecture that arise as result of alternative splicing in hypoxic cells. Using   data generated from a time course in reduced oxygenation we identified genome-wide switching between coding and noncoding isoforms, including a significant number of components of the DNA damage response pathway. Notably, HDAC6, a master regulator of the cytotoxic response, and TP53BP1, which sits at the nexus of the double-strand break repair pathway, both underwent a marked transition towards an intron-retention pattern with a concomitant decline in protein levels. These transitions from coding to noncoding isoforms were recapitulated in a large and independent cohort of 499 colorectal samples taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The set of altered genes was enriched for multiple components of the Fanconi Anaemia, nucleotide excision and double-strand break repair pathways, and together correlating with tumour status at last contact. Altogether, these data demonstrate a new role for hypoxia-driven alternative splicing in regulating DNA damage response, and highlight the importance of considering alternative splicing as a critical factor in our understanding of human disease.},

In recent years, increasing evidence has shown that aberrant activation of Notch is associated with tumor process. Aberrant activation of Notch signaling pathway has been found in many different solid tumors can induce cell proliferation, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Notch receptor and its ligand are both single transmembrane protein, and Notch is activated when it binds to the Notch ligand of neighbor cells. The signal transduction of Notch signaling pathway is only between cells that are in contact with each other, which is independent of second messengers. Thus, Notch needs to cross talk with other signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, NF-κB, integrin and miRNAs, to precisely regulate cell fate. In this review, we summarize the roles of Notch signaling pathway in tumor metastasis and its regulatory mechanisms and discuss the current treatment strategies targeting Notch signal pathway.},

In contrast to normal cells, cancer cells coopt this pathway to propagate structural and numerical chromosomal instabilities. Cells derived from genomically unstable tumors exhibit evidence for a partially activated DDR during mitosis, which leads to ongoing chromosome segregation errors. Thus, a thorough understanding of the consequences of mitotic DNA damage is key to our ability to devise novel anticancer therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract        = {Apoptosis can be induced in response to hypoxia. The severity of hypoxia determines whether cells become apoptotic or adapt to hypoxia and survive. A hypoxic environment devoid of nutrients prevents the cell undergoing energy dependent apoptosis and cells become necrotic. Apoptosis regulatory proteins are delicately balanced. In solid tumours, hypoxia is a common phenomenon. Cells adapt to this environmental stress, so that after repeated periods of hypoxia, selection for resistance to hypoxia induced apoptosis occurs. These resistant tumours probably have a more aggressive phenotype and may have decreased responsiveness to treatment. The key regulator of this process, hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), can initiate apoptosis by inducing high concentrations of proapoptotic proteins, such as BNIP3, and can cause stabilisation of p53. However, during hypoxia, antiapoptotic proteins, such as IAP-2, can be induced, whereas the proapoptotic protein Bax can be downregulated. During hypoxia, an intricate balance exists between factors that induce or counteract apoptosis, or even stimulate proliferation. Understanding the regulation of apoptosis during hypoxia and the mechanisms of resistance to apoptosis might lead to more specific treatments for solid tumours.},

  abstract        = {The Notch pathway is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. The Notch signaling pathway is one of the most commonly activated signaling pathways in cancer. Alterations include activating mutations and amplification of the Notch pathway, which play key roles in the progression of cancer. Accumulating evidence suggests that the pharmacological inhibition of this pathway can overcome chemoresistance. Efforts have been taken to develop Notch inhibitors as a single agent or in combination with clinically used chemotherapeutics to treat cancer. Some Notch inhibitors have been demonstrated to have therapeutic efficacy in preclinical studies. This review summarizes the recent studies and clinical evaluations of the Notch inhibitors in cancer. },
