The figure \ref{fig:gantt} show a Gantt Diagram with the initial planning of the project.
It is divided in the following milestones needed to the accomplishment of the project:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Definition and planning: this milestone consists on the definition of the project and its planning.
    \item State of the art: to accomplish this milestone, a deep study on the recent activities in the field will be done.
    \item Design and implementation: during this stage, the implementation of the study will be carried on.
    \item Write the report: once the previous step is finish, a report explaining the results must be written.
    \item Thesis defense: a presentation of the current work must be done to accomplish this milestone.
    \item Public presentation: as a last step, the work must be publicly presented to an academic trial.
\end{itemize}

An extra column has been added to the Gantt diagram to illustrate the relation between the milestones and the corresponding phase or phases of a CRISP-DM project.
