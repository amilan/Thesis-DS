\section{Project Objectives}
\subsection{Primary}
Analysis of the similarities of the gene expression regulated by Cyclin D1 in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and the gene expression of the DNA-damage response (DDR) using Machine Learning.

\subsection{Secondaries}
To generate a gene signature in which the significantly enriched genes are identified in order to study its possible role as a potential therapeutic target as a biomarker.
