\section{Project Objectives}
\subsection{General}
Analysis of the similarities of the gene expression regulated by Cyclin D1 in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and the gene expression of the DNA-damage response (DDR) using Machine Learning.

\subsection{Specific}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify significantly enriched genes that can act as a therapeutic target and as a biomarker.
    \item Create machine learning models to boost the process of identification of the significantly enriched genes.
\end{itemize}
