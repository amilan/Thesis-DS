One of the purposes of this study was to include more Feature Selection algorithms in the pipelines, but due to the lack of time this objective is left for future improvements.

The idea of integrating more than one Feature Selection algorithm was to execute several of them in parallel and combine their results. This combination can be done matching the common genes that are selected by each algorithm and perform GSEA over that new set of genes.

Another point worth to comment is the optimization of the model created by the Random Forest algorithm. In this study no optimization has been performed, as the main objective was to extract the most important features and a considerable number of features was going to be selected, but if a more accurate or reduced selection of genes is desired, this point could be considered.

For this study, only two data sets were evaluated, the addition of more data sets could be also considered.

Finally, further experimental studies would be required to validate this in silico analysis.

% Another improvement can be the usage of Supervised methods of Feature Selection. This Supervised method can be done adding a new vector of labels. This labels can be \textit{MCL} and \textit{DDR} and can be associated to the samples that comes from the MCL dataset and the DDR data set respectively.
